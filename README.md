# Fallout Save Editor

Fallout-se is a modern cross-platform, open source, save file parsers and editor for fallout 1 and 2.

I started this project because the most popular save file editor, [Fallache](https://www.nma-fallout.com/resources/falche-fallout-1-editor.15/), is Windows only, closed source and appears unmaintained as far as I can tell.

I have also found [ultimate Fallout 1 & 2 save file editor](https://github.com/nousrnam/F12se) which is open source, but still not cross platform (it has Windows XP support though :D).

I'm starting with Fallout 1 and I'll add functionality as I work through Fallout 2, but you can send me your save files (if they don't dump properly). But it's limited because I only have my own saves to work from which I diversified a bit with Fallache.

## Project Goals
- Parity with the famous Fallache.
- Library backend with even more features.
- TUI primarily (for that Fallout vibe).
- GUI for the plebs.

## Features

### Working
- Basic dumping SAVE.DAT for Fallout 1 and 2

### Not Working
- Any editing :)

## License
Apache and MIT for maximal flexibility.
